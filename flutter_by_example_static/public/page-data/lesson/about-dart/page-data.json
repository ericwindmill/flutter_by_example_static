Google depends on Dart to make very large apps.\n> -dartlang.org\n\nThe first hurdle for most would-be Flutter developers is being convinced to\n learn a new, sparsely used Language: Dart. (Although, Dart has been growing\n like crazy, thanks to Flutter. More on that in a bit.)  \n \nIn order to write Flutter apps, it's important that you also learn Dart. We\n'll do that first:\n\nDart is a programming language. And programming languages can be, as it turns\nout, hard to learn. The fundamentals of Dart are similar to all higher-level\nlanguages. You'll find familiarity in Dart syntax if you're coming from\nJavaScript, Java, or any other C-like language. You'll feel comfortable with\nDart's object-oriented design if you're coming from Ruby or Python.\n\nDart excels at being a \"safe\" language to learn. Google didn't set out to\n create anything innovative with Dart. Google wanted to make a language that\n was simple and productive and that could be compiled into JavaScript. What\n Google came up with, it turns out, works well for writing UIs.\n \nIn a nutshell, Dart is an object-oriented, class defined, single inheritance\nlanguage using a C-style syntax that transcompiles optionally into\nJavaScript. It supports interfaces, mixins, abstract classes, reified\ngenerics, optional typing, and a sound type system.\n\nLastly, Dart is always improving quite a bit. It is very much in constant\n development. Don't worry, though. There won't be any new breaking changes\n , just improvements and additional features.\n\n### Why Does Flutter Use Dart?\n\nTo us, the mobile developers, Flutter appears to be nothing more than a Dart\nlibrary (although it is much more under the hood). So, why does Flutter rely\nso heavily on this relatively unknown language?\n\nAccording to members of the Flutter team themselves, there are several\n reasons. Let's get the controversial reason out of the way first:  \n\nDart is owned and maintained by Google. I think Google owning Dart _is_ an\n advantage. In the last few years, Dart has made great strides to be a nice\nlanguage specifically for writing modern UIs. The Dart team and Flutter team\n get to work closely together on feature development. This relationship\n  allows Dart to support Flutter, rather than Flutter rely on outside forces. \n\n- Dart supports both just in time (JIT) compiling and ahead of time (AOT\n) compiling:\n-- The AOT compiler changes Dart into efficient native code. This makes Flutter\n fast (a win for the user and the developer), but it also means that (nearly) the entire framework is written in Dart. For you, the developer, that means you can customize almost everything.\n-- Dart's optional JIT compiling allows hot-reloading to exist. Fast\n development and iteration is a key to the joy of using Flutter.\n- Dart is object-oriented. This makes it easy to write visual user\n experiences with Dart, with no need for a markup language.\n- Dart is a productive, predictable language. Whether you come from a dynamic language or a static\n  language, you can get up and running with ease. \n- The type system and object orientation make it easy to reason about writing\n reusable components for the UI. \n- And, Dart includes a few functional programming features that make it\n easier to turn your data into pieces of UI.\n - Finally, asynchronous, stream -based programming features are first-class\ncitizens in Dart. These features are used heavily in reactive programming, which is the paradigm of today. \n\nLastly, Dart excels at being a language that's easy to learn. As a co-worker\n of mine said about hiring, \"We don't have to find Dart people, only smart people.\" \n ","updated_at":"Saturday, 20th of June, 2020","slug":"about-dart","strapiId":3,"title":"About Dart","tutorial":{"category":"Dart","title":"Getting Started with Dart"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"about-dart"}}}
